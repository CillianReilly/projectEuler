My solutions to the first 100 Euler Problems on https://projecteuler.net  
I've currently solved 67 problems in total, 63 of which are in the first 100.  

Per the homepage, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.
